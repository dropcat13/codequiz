# homework4-codequiz

### User Story
The user wants to play a quiz to help them learn to remember coding facts. When they open the first screen they will see a title and a start quiz button. 
On clicking the startquiz button, a timer will start (15 secs per question), and the first question will be displayed. after they have clicked an answer, the next question will be displayed and so on. If the user answers correctly they will score a point, if they answer incorrectly 10 seconds will be deducted from their timer. After the last question has been answered the user will see a well done screen telling them what their score was and prompting them to enter their score into highscores. There is also a restart button at this point if the user wants to play again. The username and high score will be stored in local storage, so that high scores can be compared to each other.
